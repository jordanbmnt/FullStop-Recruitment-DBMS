# 💬 Why the Name “Arskipos”?

“Arskipos” is stylized form or variation of the Greek word ἐπίσκοπος (episkopos), which means overseer or bishop — a term used in the New Testament for spiritual leaders or shepherds of a community.

- "Ars" could suggest artistry, archive, or architecture, implying structure or curation.
- "Kipos" might subtly reference episkopos, pointing to spiritual oversight, stewardship, or leadership.

Altogether, “Arskipos” evokes the idea of someone entrusted with carefully managing lives, callings, or vocations — a poetic metaphor for managing CVs in a spiritually informed and purposeful way.
