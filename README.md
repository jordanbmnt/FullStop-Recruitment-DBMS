# About The Project
This project addresses a critical challenge faced by FullStop Recruiter: the lack of a centralized and scalable system for managing CV uploads. Currently, the company struggles with inefficient methods for handling incoming resumes, hindering their ability to grow and effectively process candidate information.

The FullStop Recruiter CV Management System is a bespoke, free-to-use application designed exclusively for FullStop Recruiter to streamline their CV handling process. It provides a dedicated platform to:

Manage CVs: Securely upload and store candidate resumes within a database.
Send Out Forms: Facilitate the distribution of necessary forms to candidates.
Visualize Data: Display insightful charts that provide an overview of candidate demographics (types of people) and common job titles, aiding in strategic recruitment decisions.
Unlike generic CV management tools, this system is tailored specifically to FullStop Recruiter's unique needs, ensuring a focused and highly relevant solution without the complexities or costs associated with broader platforms.
